This is what Bob & Carol did on Bob’s computer when working on the first feature

TODO FOUR TIMES!!!
Do this exercise four times, following the steps below: once with each team member in each role.

DONE.
For the purposes of this exercise, the work you’re doing on a feature, always in FUBAR.md, consists of adding a sentence or two of “This is what Bob & Carol did on Bob’s computer when working on the first feature” and maybe a joke or something to keep your teammates amused.

DONE.
Bob and Carol get their feature finished and do a A-C-P of their branch from Carol’s laptop and make a PR.

UNKNOWN.
Ted & Alice review the feature, approve that it is good and subsequently merge it.
Ted & Alice then do a git pull origin main into their feature branch on Ted’s laptop ONLY and continue working on that feature.
In the meantime…

IN PROGRESS....
Bob & Carol have switched to Bob’s laptop, started a new feature branch in FUBAR.md, and started working on it. They did not do a git pull origin main and will live to regret it.

OH NO!!!
They finish that feature at the same time that Ted & Alice finish their feature.


Each team does an A-C-P and makes a pull request.
They review each other’s PRs and attempt to merge them.
Merge Conflicts…

To sort out a merge conflict, check all of your project files for the markers that indicate merge conflicts, the >>>>>>>>> and HEAD lines of code. Edit the code to remove the redundancies causing the merge conflict, and eliminate the markers.
Get everyone’s individual laptop back in sync by doing a git pull origin main into main until Git stops no longer sees any conflicts.
Then they switch partners, of course. Bob & Alice start a quick new feature on her laptop in the main branch and Ted & Carol start another new feature of their own, also in main.
They finish these quick features, and attempt to A-C-P and create/merge PRs.
Resolve any merge conflicts in the same manner as above if there are any pending.
